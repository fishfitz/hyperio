description: >
  Lost Idols is a series of fictional copper relics from forgotten civilizations.
  Blending speculative archaeology with science fiction, they intentionally blur historical, cultural and theological references.
  These damaged remnants of hybrid deities, outliving their own myths, question how humans project belief into material form.
