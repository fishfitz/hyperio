Hyperio (they/them) is an artist and jeweler based in Nantes, France. Their work sits at the intersection of precious objects and biomorphic artifacts. They use innovative fabrication techniques to give life to organic shapes that would be difficult to achieve through traditional methods.

Each piece is crafted from start to finish at Hyperio's Nantes workshop.
